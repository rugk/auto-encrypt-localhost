# Developer Documentation

This documentation includes the implementation details of Auto Encrypt Localhost and is intended to aid you if you’re trying to improve, debug, or get a deeper understanding of Auto Encrypt.

If you just want to use Auto Encrypt Localhost, please see the public API, as documented in the [README](readme.md).

## Requirements

Auto Encrypt Localhost is supported on:

  - __Node:__ LTS (currently 14.16.0).
  - __ECMAScript:__ [ES2019](https://node.green/#ES2019)

## Overview of relationships

![Dependency relationship diagram for Auto Correct](artefacts/dependency-graph.svg)

__Not shown (for clarity):__ third-party Node modules, the `util` namespace with helper modules – for logging, error handling, and an async `forEach` implementation – and the `typedefs` namespace with JSDoc type definitions.

Generated using [dependency cruiser](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser).

To run dependency cruiser, you will need to [install Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/).

## How it works in more detail

Auto Encrypt Localhost is a Node.js wrapper for [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/) that, at the npm post-install stage:

  - Downloads and uses correct mkcert release binary for you machine on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

And, on first run (or if the root certificate authority or your TLS certificates are missing):

  - Automatically installs the _certutil_ (nss) dependency on Linux on systems with apt, pacman, yum (untested) and  and on macOS if you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) (untested).

  - Creates a root Certificate Authority.

  - Creates locally-trusted TLS certificates for localhost, 127.0.0.1, and ::1.

You can use these certificates for local development without triggering self-signed certificate errors.

At runtime, you can use the library to create your HTTPS servers instead of using the built-in Node.js `https` module.

For more details on how Auto Encrypt Localhost works behind the scenes, please [see the mkcert README](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/blob/master/README.md).

## Tests

```sh
npm -s test
```

To see debug output, run `npm -s run test-debug` instead.

Note that [npm cannot prompt for sudo passwords due to a bug](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/2887) so you will be prompted for your password prior to the running of the tests in order to unlock sudo while the tests are running.

On Windows, run the following command instead:

```sh
npm -s run test-on-windows
```

## Coverage

```sh
npm -s run coverage
```

To see debug output, run `npm -s run coverage-debug` instead.

On Windows, run the following command instead:

```sh
npm -s run coverage-on-windows
```

### module.exports ⏏
Auto Encrypt Localhost is a static class. Please do not instantiate.

Use: AutoEncryptLocalhost.https.createServer(…)

**Kind**: Exported class  
<a name="module_@small-tech/auto-encrypt-localhost--module.exports.https"></a>

#### module.exports.https
By aliasing the https property to the AutoEncryptLocalhost static class itself, we enable
people to add AutoEncryptLocalhost to their existing apps by importing the module
and prefixing their https.createServer(…) line with AutoEncryptLocalhost:

**Kind**: static property of [<code>module.exports</code>](#exp_module_@small-tech/auto-encrypt-localhost--module.exports)  
**Example**  
```js
import AutoEncryptLocalhost from '@small-tech/auto-encrypt-localhost'
const server = AutoEncryptLocalhost.https.createServer()
```
<a name="module_@small-tech/auto-encrypt-localhost--module.exports.createServer"></a>

#### module.exports.createServer([options]) ⇒ <code>https.Server</code>
Automatically provisions trusted development-time (localhost) certificates in Node.js via mkcert.

**Kind**: static method of [<code>module.exports</code>](#exp_module_@small-tech/auto-encrypt-localhost--module.exports)  
**Returns**: <code>https.Server</code> - The server instance returned by Node’s https.createServer() method.  

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [options] | <code>Object</code> |  | Optional HTTPS options object with optional additional                                           Auto Encrypt-specific configuration settings. |
| [options.settingsPath] | <code>String</code> | <code>~/.small-tech.org/auto-encrypt-localhost/</code> | Custom path to save the certificate and private key to. |
